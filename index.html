                          <p class="card-text">My name is Maxx Sanner and I am a Systems Application Engineer at <a href="https://www.QSC.com" target="_blank">QSC</a>, a manufacturer of professional audio, video, and control equipment and software. I received a Bachelor of Science in Physics along with a Bachelor of Arts in Music, with an emphasis in voice, from California State University, Fullerton in 2018. <br><br> As part of my current job, I assist integrators using our product doing anything from providing technical support and troubleshooting to helping them program audio, video, and control systems for professional venues such as sports stadiums, museums, houses of worship, conference rooms, hospitals, music halls, etc. Specifically, our software, Q-Sys Designer, gives the user the ability to input their own Lua code for control scripting. Because of this, I have grown somewhat sufficient in Lua and understanding how to program systems. I have created my own scripts such as a QWERTY keyboard, password protection for UI's, and timeout splashscreens using Lua which are being utilized on user interfaces in multiple systems around the country.<br><br> I am currently enrolled in a coding boot camp at UC Irvine where I am learning full stack web development and hope to grow this portfolio in the coming months.</p>
